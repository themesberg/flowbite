## Introduction

Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components based on the utility-first Tailwind CSS framework featuring dark mode support, a Figma design system, and more.

It includes all of the commonly used components that a website requires, such as buttons, dropdowns, navigation bars, modals, but also some more advanced interactive elements such as datepickers. 

All of the elements are built using the utility classes from Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

Here's a quick overview of the Flowbite ecosystem including the open source Tailwind components library, the Figma design files, and the pro version.

## Using Flowbite

One of the disadvantages of Tailwind CSS compared to other frameworks is that it doesn't have a base set of components. This makes it really hard to quickly prototype a user interface. 

This is where Flowbite comes into play: it's basically Tailwind CSS, but you get all of the components that you would normally get with a classic CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma.

There are 52 types of UI components including buttons, alerts, breadcrumbs, pagination, and navbars. Flowbite also includes some custom JavaScript that enables interactive components, such as dropdowns, modals, tooltips, and many more. 

## Getting started

Flowbite is technically a plugin that can be included into any existing Tailwind CSS project. To get started, you first need to make sure that you have a working Tailwind CSS project installed and that you also have Node and NPM installed on your machine.

### Require via NPM

1. Install the latest version of Flowbite using NPM:

```bash
npm install flowbite
```

2. Use the Flowbite CLI and run the following command to set up Flowbite in the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```bash
npx flowbite init
```

This will either generate a new default Tailwnd configuration file with Flowbite installed or set up Flowbite inside an existing Tailwind CSS project:

```javascript
module.exports = {

  // other options ...

  content: [
    // other templates paths...
    "./node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js"
  ]

  plugins: [
    // other plugins...
    require('flowbite/plugin')
  ],

}
```

3. Include the main JavaScript file to make interactive elements work:

```html
<script src="../path/to/flowbite/dist/flowbite.js"></script>
```

### Include via CDN

If you want to quickly test out Flowbite you can easily include the following CSS and JavaScript files.

Require the following minified stylesheet inside the `head` tag:

```html
<link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/{{< current_version >}}/flowbite.min.css"  rel="stylesheet" />
```

And include the following javascript file before the end of the `body` element:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flowbite/{{< current_version >}}/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

Please remember that the best way to work with Tailwind CSS and Flowbite is by purging the CSS classes.

### Bundled JavaScript

One of the most popular way of using Flowbite is to include the bundled Javascript file which is UMD ready using a bundler such as Webpack or Parcel which makes sure that all of the data attributes and functionality will work out-of-the-box.

You can directly import the main JavaScript file inside your bundled `app-bundle.js` file like this:

```javascript
import 'flowbite';
```

This file has access to all of the components and it automatically applies event listeners to the data attributes.

### Data attributes

The preferred way to use the interactive UI components from Flowbite is via the data attributes interface which allows us to add functionality via the HTML element attributes and most of the examples on our documentation applies this strategy.

For example, to set up a modal component all you need to do is use `data-modal-target` and `data-modal-{toggle|show|hide}` to toggle, show, or hide the component by clicking on any trigger element.

### ESM and CJS

Flowbite also offers an API for using the components programmatically and it supports both CJS and ESM for JavaScript which can be helpful if you need to expand the default capabilities of the data attributes interface and get access to function callbacks.

Here's an example how you can import and create a new Modal component inside JavaScript:

```javascript
import { Modal } from 'flowbite'

const $modalElement = document.querySelector('#modalEl');

const modalOptions = {
    placement: 'bottom-right',
    backdrop: 'dynamic',
    backdropClasses: 'bg-gray-900 bg-opacity-50 dark:bg-opacity-80 fixed inset-0 z-40',
    onHide: () => {
        console.log('modal is hidden');
    },
    onShow: () => {
        console.log('modal is shown');
    },
    onToggle: () => {
        console.log('modal has been toggled');
    }
}

const modal = new Modal($modalElement, modalOptions);

modal.show();
```

Check out the JavaScript behaviour section of each component's page to learn how you can use this.

### TypeScript

Flowbite supports type declarations for the interactive UI components including object interfaces and parameter types. Check out the following examples to learn how you can use types with Flowbite.

Additionally to our code above, we will now import some relevant types from the Flowbite package, namely the `ModalOptions` and `ModalInterface`:

```javascript
import { Modal } from 'flowbite'
import type { ModalOptions, ModalInterface } from 'flowbite'

// other code
```

Learn more about Flowbite and TypeScript in the [quickstart guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/typescript/).

## Tailwind CSS 2.0

Flowbite is fully compatible with the 2.x versions of Tailwind CSS.

## Tailwind CSS 3.0

Feel free to upgrade to version 3 of Tailwind CSS as there are no breaking changes when using the components from Flowbite.

## WindiCSS

Flowbite also works with WindiCSS.

Just include the WindiCSS version of the Flowbite plugin inside the `windi.config.js` file.

```bash
plugins: [
    require('flowbite/plugin-windicss')
],
```

## Figma design system

The components from Flowbite are first conceptualized and designed in Figma using the latest features such as variants, auto-layout, grids, responsive layouts, and more.
