MCP UI is the standard SDK that you can use to deliver MCP apps which can be used as applications for ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other MCP clients like Cursor or Windsurf. [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) (MCP) is part of the Agentic AI Foundation donated by Anthropic in 2025 and it is one of the fastest growing open-source projects in the AI category with over 100 million monthly SDK downloads.

In this guide you will learn how to create an MCP app using Flowbite and Skybridge and start developing application for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and any other AI client that uses the MCP standard. After setting up the project you'll be able to integrate any UI component and theme from the Flowbite documentation inside your MCP application.

We decided to use the [Skybridge](https://github.com/alpic-ai/skybridge) framework to build MCP apps and we are using the UI components from [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/).

## Create new MCP app

The first step is to create a new MCP application and start developing locally:

1. Download or clone the [MCP UI Starter](https://github.com/themesberg/mcp-ui-starter/) repository:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
git clone https://github.com/themesberg/mcp-ui-starter.git
{{< /code >}}

2. Install dependencies using NPM, PNPM, Yarn or Bun:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
npm install
{{< /code >}}

3. Run a local development server:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
npm run dev --use-forwarded-host
{{< /code >}}

This command will run a local server on `http://localhost:3000` and will create the following:

- the main MCP server on the `/mcp` endpoint
- a collection of widgets built with Flowbite and React used as tools

## Connect with NGROK

In order to expose the server to AI clients such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude we need to host the MCP server.

Install `ngrok` on your computer using Homebrew and run the following command:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
ngrok http 3000
{{< /code >}}

This will host the MCP server on a URL similar to this one:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
# this is just an example
https://3785c5ddc4b6.ngrok-free.app/mcp
{{< /code >}}

You will now be able to use this URL to create an application for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and for any MCP clients.

Don't forget to add the `/mcp` endpoint to the URL generated by NGROK.

## Install on AI providers

Use the following guides to connect your MCP app to major AI providers like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

### ChatGPT apps

Make sure that you have a paid plan to create an application on ChatGPT.

1. Go to Settings > Connectors
2. Scroll down and click on "Advanced Settings"
3. Enable Developer mode
4. Go back to the Settings > Connectors page, and click on "Create in the Browser Connectors"
5. Add a custom connector with the MCP Server URL: `[NGROK_FORWARDING_URL]/mcp`
6. Click on "Create to add the MCP server as a Connector"
7. To use your newly created connector in the chat, click + then More and select it.

### Claude Web

Make sure that you have a paid plan to create an application on Claude.

1. Go to Settings > Connectors
2. Locate the "Connectors" section
3. Click "Add custom connector" at the bottom of the section
4. Add your connector's remote MCP server URL: [NGROK_FORWARDING_URL]/mcp
5. Finish configuring your connector and click Add
6. To enable connectors, use the Search and tools button on the lower left of the chat.

### Gemini CLI

Run the following command in your terminal:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
gemini mcp add --transport http <server-name> "[NGROK_FORWARDING_URL]/mcp"
{{< /code >}}

Use `/mcp` in the Gemini CLI terminal to view your recently added MCP server status and discovered tools.

### Cursor

Add your MCP server to Cursor by opening the `mcp.json` file and configure it using `mcpServers`.

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<server-name>": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "[NGROK_FORWARDING_URL]/mcp"
    }
  }
}
{{< /code >}}

### VS Code

To add your MCP server to VS Code you need to open the `.vscode/mcp.json` file and configure `servers`.

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
{
  "servers": {
    "<server-name>": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "[NGROK_FORWARDING_URL]/mcp"
    }
  }
}
{{< /code >}}

### Claude Code

MCP servers are stored at `~/.claude.json` in Claude Code. Use the CLI to add your MCP app:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
claude mcp add --transport http <server-name> "[NGROK_FORWARDING_URL]/mcp"
{{< /code >}}

### Mistral AI

1. Open the side panel and expand Intelligence > Connectors
2. Click "+ Add Connector" on the right side of the page
3. In the MCP Connectors directory, click the "Custom MCP Connector tab"
4. Enter a Connector Name and the following Connector Server URL: `[NGROK_FORWARDING_URL]/mcp`
5. Finish configuring your connector and click "Create"
6. To use the connector, click the Tools button below the chat input and enable it in the Connectors section.

### Codex

MCP servers in Codex are located at `~/.codex/config.toml` and you can install your MCP app using the CLI:

{{< code lang="bash" >}}
codex mcp add <server-name> --url "[NGROK_FORWARDING_URL]/mcp"
{{< /code >}}

## Create a widget

## Update theming

## Build for production

## Host your MCP app
